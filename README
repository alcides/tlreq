Tex Live Dependency Manager
==========================

Everytime you move your LaTeX project to another machine/environment, you have to reinstall all the packages required by your project. By declaring all the CTAN's packages you use in your project in a simple text file named requirements.tlp, this tool will allow you to execute "sudo tlreq" and have tlmgr install all of them.

INSTALATION
===========

chmod +x tlreq and move it to somewhere on your path.

CONTRIBUTE: MAKEFILE wanted.

USAGE
=====

Load 'requirements.tlp':
  sudo tlreq 

Load 'example.tlp':
  sudo tlreq example.tlp
